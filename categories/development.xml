Also, I (pretend to be) a developer. I already have a &lt;a href="http://adammichaelwood.com"&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a lot of poetry and theology and stuff like that on it. So have started writing about writing about development. And this is a crappy example post that is being used to test my design styles. Here is an unordered list describing things I have written up until now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;poetry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stuff like that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is an ordered list of things I should be writing about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing about writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing about development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing about writing about development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I write about techy things for a living. So I'm trying to write about techy things for my personal blog also. Because personal branding and things like that. Here is a quote about that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal branding is very important.&lt;br&gt;
--- Everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is where I will write about all the development things that I happen to think about on a daily basis. One of the things that will matter is code samples. Here is a code sample:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"python"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"I am trying to learn &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design is all about syntax highlighting regular text. Is this is a good idea? I don't know. Maybe it will be awesome. Maybe it will be nerdly in a good way. Or maybe it will seem like I am trying too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some of the markup Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline numbering is CSS. The list item bullets are just plain hyphens. The coloring of various things is the way I see them in my text editor. Did you notice the almost-invisible HTML tags here and there? Like at the end of paragraphs and before and after blockquotes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is awesome. Do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here is another headline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I wanted to see some good auto-numbering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>development</category><category>writing</category><guid>http://adammichaelwood.com/another-test-site/posts/writing-about-writing-about-development/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 00:53:49 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
