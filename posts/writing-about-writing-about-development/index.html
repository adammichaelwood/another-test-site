<p>I am a writer. Also, I (pretend to be) a developer. I already have a <a href="http://adammichaelwood.com">personal blog</a>, but it has a lot of poetry and theology and stuff like that on it. So have started writing about writing about development. And this is a crappy example post that is being used to test my design styles. Here is an unordered list describing things I have written up until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>poetry</li>
<li>theology</li>
<li>stuff like that</li>
</ul>
<p>But here is an ordered list of things I should be writing about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing about writing</li>
<li>Writing about development</li>
<li>Writing about writing about development</li>
</ol>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Basically, I write about techy things for a living. So I'm trying to write about techy things for my personal blog also. Because personal branding and things like that. Here is a quote about that sort of thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personal branding is very important.<br>
--- Everyone</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>This blog is where I will write about all the development things that I happen to think about on a daily basis. One of the things that will matter is code samples. Here is a code sample:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"python"</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="s2">"I am trying to learn </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">."</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>
<p>This design is all about syntax highlighting regular text. Is this is a good idea? I don't know. Maybe it will be awesome. Maybe it will be nerdly in a good way. Or maybe it will seem like I am trying too hard.</p>
<h4>Some of the markup Details</h4>
<p>The headline numbering is CSS. The list item bullets are just plain hyphens. The coloring of various things is the way I see them in my text editor. Did you notice the almost-invisible HTML tags here and there? Like at the end of paragraphs and before and after blockquotes?</p>
<p>I think that is awesome. Do you?</p>
<h2>Here is another headline</h2>
<p>Because I wanted to see some good auto-numbering.</p>
