I am a writer. Also, I (pretend to be) a developer. I already have a [personal blog](http://adammichaelwood.com), but it has a lot of poetry and theology and stuff like that on it. So have started writing about writing about development. And this is a crappy example post that is being used to test my design styles. Here is an unordered list describing things I have written up until now:

 - poetry
 - theology
 - stuff like that

But here is an ordered list of things I should be writing about:

 1. Writing about writing
 2. Writing about development
 3. Writing about writing about development

# The problem

Basically, I write about techy things for a living. So I'm trying to write about techy things for my personal blog also. Because personal branding and things like that. Here is a quote about that sort of thing.

> Personal branding is very important.
> <cite>Everyone</cite>

## The solution

This blog is where I will write about all the development things that I happen to think about on a daily basis. One of the things that will matter is code samples. Here is a code sample:

```python

a = "python"

print "I am trying to learn %s." % a

```

## Details

This design is all about syntax highlighting regular text. Is this is a good idea? I don't know. Maybe it will be awesome. Maybe it will be nerdly in a good way. Or maybe it will seem like I am trying too hard.

### Some of the markup Details

The headline numbering is CSS. The list item bullets are just plain hyphens. The coloring of various things is the way I see them in my text editor. Did you notice the almost-invisible HTML tags here and there? Like at the end of paragraphs and before and after blockquotes?

I think that is awesome. Do you?

# Here is another headline

Because I wanted to see some good auto-numbering.
